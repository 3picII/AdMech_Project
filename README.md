AdMech
This is my passing project for Java Developer course by CodersLab.
AdMech is a Warhammer 40 000 text based game that can be played in your browser.
You run it in AdMechApplication after that you can enter http://localhost:8080/ from there you chose to register or login.
-Login: enter your character login to continue adventure 
-Register: create a new character and begin the game 
After that you will see a plain input field where (if just registered) enter n to begin your adventure
